# anki-irregular-german-verbs
A list of 170 common irregular german verbs, used to generate an Anki deck.

## Anki Deck details
The Anki deck contains a single card for each verb and each verb tense (Pr√§teritum, Partizip II, irregular present tense). The card also includes an example sentence in German with an english translation, and has a field for CEFR level and verb tense. This makes it easy to study a sub-group of words, for example to study the Partizip II for A1 verbs, create a Custom Study Session and filter by Tags.

## Updates
If you notice any errors, or want to help improve the deck, please get in touch as I may already have an updated version.
